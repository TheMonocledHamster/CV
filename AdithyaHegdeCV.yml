    experience:
      - company: "JPMorgan Chase & Co."
        position: "Software Engineer II"
        start_date: "2025-01"
        end_date: "present"
        highlights:
          - "Designed and implemented a unified Spark execution model replacing a Databricks-DynamoDB sync architecture, reducing operational failure modes and improving throughput up to 80% for large workloads without degrading small-workload performance."
          - "Introduced an input-aware short-circuit in the ingestion workflow, unnecessary Spark ingestion for empty inputs via a Lambda control path, cutting processing time from minutes to seconds and reducing compute usage by ~20%."
      - company: "JPMorgan Chase & Co."
        position: "Software Engineer I"
        start_date: "2023-07"
        end_date: "2024-12"
        highlights:
          - "Profiled memory growth of a Polars-based transformation running in AWS Lambda’s constrained runtime; introduced lazy evaluation and explicit object lifecycle control to prevent peak allocation, reducing memory usage by 60% and stabilizing execution latency."
          - "Brought up a multi-node ingestion system on Kubernetes (EKS + NiFi), implemented Airflow orchestration for distributed workflows, and operated cross-service data movement pipelines in production."
          - "Accelerated promotion to Software Engineer II for ownership of distributed data infrastructure and performance debugging in production systems.."
      - company: "JPMorgan Chase & Co."
        position: "Software Engineer Intern"
        start_date: "2023-01"
        end_date: "2023-06"
        highlights:
          - "Implemented a schema-driven validation tool generating record-level checks from external specifications, eliminating iterative reprocessing and reducing failure diagnosis time by 95%."
