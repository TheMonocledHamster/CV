    experience:
      - company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.
        position: Software Engineer II
        start_date: 2025-01
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - Designed and implemented a unified Spark execution model replacing a Databricks-DynamoDB sync architecture, reducing operational failure modes and improving throughput up to 80% for large workloads without degrading small-workload performance.
          - Introduced an input-aware short-circuit in the ingestion workflow, unnecessary Spark ingestion for empty inputs via a Lambda control path, cutting processing time from minutes to seconds and reducing compute usage by ~20%.

        position: Software Engineer I
        start_date: 2023-07
        end_date: 2024-12
        highlights:
          - Profiled memory growth of a Polars-based transformation running in AWS Lambda's constrained runtime; introduced lazy evaluation and explicit object lifecycle control to prevent peak allocation, reducing memory usage by 60% and stabilizing execution latency.
          - Brought up a multi-node ingestion system on Kubernetes (EKS + NiFi), implemented Airflow orchestration for distributed workflows, and operated cross-service data movement pipelines in production.
          - Accelerated promotion to Software Engineer II for ownership of distributed data infrastructure and performance debugging in production systems.
      - company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.
        position: Software Engineer Intern
        start_date: 2023-01
        end_date: 2023-06
        highlights:
          - Implemented a schema-driven validation tool generating record-level checks from external specifications, eliminating iterative reprocessing and reducing failure diagnosis time by 95%.
