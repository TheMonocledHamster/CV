# Experience
## **Software Engineer II**, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Jan 2025 – present

- Designed and implemented a unified Spark execution model replacing a Databricks-DynamoDB sync architecture, reducing operational failure modes and improving throughput up to 80% for large workloads without degrading small-workload performance.

- Introduced an input-aware short-circuit in the ingestion workflow, unnecessary Spark ingestion for empty inputs via a Lambda control path, cutting processing time from minutes to seconds and reducing compute usage by ~20%.



## **Software Engineer I**, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

July 2023 – Dec 2024

- Profiled memory growth of a Polars-based transformation running in AWS Lambda’s constrained runtime; introduced lazy evaluation and explicit object lifecycle control to prevent peak allocation, reducing memory usage by 60% and stabilizing execution latency.

- Brought up a multi-node ingestion system on Kubernetes (EKS + NiFi), implemented Airflow orchestration for distributed workflows, and operated cross-service data movement pipelines in production.

- Accelerated promotion to Software Engineer II for ownership of distributed data infrastructure and performance debugging in production systems.



## **Software Engineer Intern**, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Jan 2023 – June 2023

- Implemented a schema-driven validation tool generating record-level checks from external specifications, eliminating iterative reprocessing and reducing failure diagnosis time by 95%.



# Education
